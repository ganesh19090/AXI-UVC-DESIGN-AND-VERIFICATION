This is the AXI 3 protocol implementation.Initially started with rtl for master and slave supporting "FIXED", "INCR", "WRAP" burst mode with single transaction. The rtl are coded in verilog.RTL is compiled and tested with the provided testbench. Working on developing rtl for supporting other defined modes and transactions. We will be very happy to receive any kind of feedback regarding our implementation.
